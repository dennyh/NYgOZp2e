            <p>Very tasty. I browned mine in a skillet then transferred to the oven to finish up. I used some of the mushroom sauce instead of the milk. And I also seasoned the meat mixture. I used Beef, Pork and Veal as the meat mixture. Meatballs were very moist and tender. Sauce was perfect. I used No yolk noodles. VFE, I will make this one again. </p>

            <p>Super quick and easy! I also baked the meatballs in the oven, and subbed cream of chicken soup for the mushroom since hubby doesn't care for them. </p>

            <p>Quick, easy, delicious! Our boys loved it, even though they don't like mushrooms, soup, or sour cream individually. I did it by partially baking the meatballs in the oven, and letting the meatballs finish cooking the sauce on the stove. </p>

            <p>Great basic recipe! I added a dash of nutmeg to the meatballs and I cooked them on the stove till brown. Put them into a 8x8 baking dish and poured the sauce on top. To the sauce I added 1/2 cup or so of sliced baby bella mushrooms and a splash of dry sherry, and a little more sour cream. Baked till sauce was bubbling. served over rice! Delish!! :)</p>

            <p>I was looking for a simple Swedish meatball recipe to use for supper and this was the winner! However, I did not make this in the microwave. I cooked the meatballs on the stove first and then added the sauce to the meatballs once they were fully cooked. (About 15 minutes) Then I let the sauce and meatballs simmer for around 10 minutes. This recipe was very flavorful and delicious! I am definitely going to make these more often.</p>

            <p>What an easy recipe to make. It came out wonderful and was so easy to make. Since many of the reveiws mentioned that it needed more seasonings, I used Italian Bread Crumbs and added 1 minced garlic clove. Be sure to cut the onions very small. For convenience, I made the meatballs and sauce earlier in the day and stored them in the fridge. At supper I took them out and followed the cooking directions. Most of the process was done while the noodles cooked, using a minimum of pans. This was the easiest recipe I found and it works and tastes great. </p>

            Made this tonight with a few changes due to the fact I have had gastric bypass surgery and can't have a lot of fat in my diet, but I wanted flavor. I saw a few reviews used dry onion soup mix so i did that as well as used some Worcestershire sauce, Italian dressing, Parmesan cheese and omitted the onions. I cooked for 7 1/2 minutes but I should have checked after 5 they are a bit over done and tough. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added cardamom instead of nutmeg. I also did not add salt because of the salt in the two soups. I really like it and it is a change of pace from my boring soft food diet. </p>

			<p>I loved it! So did my little dog. I gave her a meatball and she gobbled it up. I cooked them in the oven, like someone suggested in the reviews and added a dry onion soup mix to the sauce ingredients. It was a little too oniony, so next time I will only use half the package of dry onion soup. Then it should be perfect. And easy...so easy.</p>
